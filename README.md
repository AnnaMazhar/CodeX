Databases Project

To test our code, folders including html, img, php can be deployed to the local server and an SQL database can be set up to which the given sql can be imported. To perform database manipulation, access the given website which has a reasonable user interface that will guide you through the basic use cases.  (Base HTML: index.html)

Alternatively, we can give you the global link to our local server and you can test the website but you will not be able to access the database changes and it is likely that there will be lags due to poor connectivity. Thus, the first method is recommended. 

Use cases done:
1) Sign up participant
